# express-backend-template

Express powered minimal backend template  to ease development setup

## Installation

For now, it is only only available on this repo. So, you can clone it and use as starting point for your express backend projects

## Usage

Setting up express projects always involves redundant code that needs to be repeated over and over again for each project. Gets tiring, if you ask me. Life does not have to be that hard and saving time is a developer's skill. So, jump over the folder creation, boilerplate imports and get to work ASAP.

BONUS:

- Comes with winston for better developer logging (console.log does not cut it for production).
- comes with jest set up for tests. You can easily change to your favourite testing framework like mocha in two steps.
- Comes with Github Actions with cache enabled.

I will update this repo regularly to include best practices of Node Js development practices. Also, I'm working to make it available via npx ASAP. Thank you.
